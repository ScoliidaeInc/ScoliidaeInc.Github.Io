# Note for files served to any page site served

This document is mostly for a note on how to situate files served to html from github.

To deliver the file in a compatible manner use the following:
http://raw.githack.com/
To use the site paste the perma-link to the desired file into the search
The resulting output will provide two links for varying use
Development:    high traffic, low change frequency
Production :    low traffic, high change frequency

> Don't forget to update url's from development to production when done with edits to a page
